// The Receipt, in words. One home for every owner-facing "found you" sentence.
//
// Feature: proof-of-demand (R4.4, R4.5, R4.6, R4.7, R5.5, R6.3)
//
// `computeReceipt` produces the numbers; this produces the sentences the live
// panel, the Monday digest, the trial and renewal emails, the Plans panel and
// the boost scoreboard all render. Structured strings, never JSX, so an email
// template and a React panel read the identical words and the honest-copy
// property test only has one function to quantify over.
//
// Three honesty rules are enforced here in code, not left to reviewer vigilance:
//
// 1. Measurement verbs only. Area Code recorded that a consumer found the venue
//    and checked in. It never "brought", "drove", "generated" or "boosted"
//    anyone (`BANNED_CAUSAL_VERBS`).
// 2. Suppressed values say less rather than rendering a zero. A first-timer or
//    per-source clause below the Suppression_Floor, or never measured at all, is
//    omitted. An omitted clause is honest; "0 of them" is not.
// 3. A zero Found_You window points at the missing step, never at failure. With
//    an incomplete Onboarding_Checklist the next step is the flag that is
//    actually false, so the owner reads "print the QR", not "nobody came".
