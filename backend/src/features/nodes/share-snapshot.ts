/**
 * Share_Preview snapshot copy — the `og:description` line served for
 * `/node/{slug}` (proof-of-demand R1.2, R1.3).
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no I/O, no globals. Same input always yields the same line,
 * so the route can be tested without a network or a database.
 *
 * Shape of the line (segments joined by a middle dot, in discovery-DNA
 * priority order — aliveness and taste lead, gets trail):
 *
 *   {venue name} · {pulse label} · {live count} here now · {Tonight} · {gets}
 *
 *   "Ramona's · Busy · 12 here now · Amapiano tonight from 21:00 · 1 get live"
 *   "Ramona's · Quiet right now · Amapiano tonight from 21:00"
 *   "Ramona's · Be the first in"
 *
 * The pulse label is the Plain_Scale from `@area-code/shared/constants/state-labels`
 * (glyphcity-rebrand R2.1); this file holds no state words of its own.
 *
 * Honesty rules this file enforces (`honest-presence.md`):
 * - Zero live presence never reads as busy. It reads "Quiet right now", or
 *   "Be the first in" when the pulse is in the dormant band. The decayed pulse score
 *   can never promote an empty room to a busy label.
 * - The live count only appears when it is above zero; we say less rather
 *   than dressing up an empty room.
 *
 * The venue name always leads the line (design Property 4), even though the
 * design's illustrative examples omit it; `og:title` carries the name too, but
 * some crawlers render the description alone.
