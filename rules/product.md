# Product: what GlyphCity is

GlyphCity is a map-first social discovery app for South African cities
(Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban). Consumers check in at venues, earn rewards,
and see live activity on a map. Businesses see live check-ins, publish rewards,
and get anonymized intelligence on their crowd. Spoken name: Glyph. Line:
"Check the beams."

GlyphCity is one of Area Code's brands. Area Code is the operating company, an
Africa-first PR and marketing house; its other brands are Volta Seek (artists
and DJs, a separate company) and a social platform (parked). Area Code appears
only in legal text, never as an endorsement in the app. Accounts are separate
per brand and no data is shared with another brand without its own spec. The
app moves from areacode.co.za to glyphcity.com in the `glyphcity-rebrand` spec;
areacode.co.za then serves Area Code's own site, from the separate `areacode`
repo. The app name, domain and company name live in
`packages/shared/constants/brand.ts`; never type them as literals.

The product is trust in a live signal. The map pulls people toward places that
are alive and full of their kind of crowd, not toward whatever is closest. See
`discovery-dna-vibe-over-convenience.md` and `honest-presence.md` for the
binding rules behind that promise.

## Platform focus

- Consumer web + mobile: mobile-first, 375px baseline, real touch targets.
- Staff: mobile-first, simple validator UI.
- Business: responsive, works on phone and desktop.
- Admin: responsive, works on phone and desktop.

## Map membership (which venues appear)

The consumer map shows only paid-tier venues. A venue joins the map when its
owning business is on a paid tier (`starter`, `payg`, `growth`, `pro`) and the
node is active. Free-tier businesses and orphan/legacy nodes (no `businessId`)
are excluded. The rule lives in `backend/src/features/nodes/repository.ts`
`getNodesByCitySlug` and the broadcast path in `nodes/service.ts`.

Membership is a hard gate, separate from ranking. Business tier is also a minor
lever inside `vibeRank` that breaks ties among equally-alive, equally-taste-matched
venues (below taste and aliveness), but that lever is a different mechanism from
the membership gate. The membership gate keys off the stored tier plus `isActive`;
the single removal mechanism is storage demotion after the non-payment grace
window. This is a recorded decision: see `docs/decisions/map-membership.md`. Any
change to paid-only membership is a follow-up spec, not a silent edit.

## Gets (rewards) product rules

Gets are a free engagement layer, not a deals catalog. Belonging beats bargains:
a get is the cherry on top of vibe-first discovery, never the reason to open the
app. These are hard rules.

- **No standalone gets/deals browse surface.** The consumer app is four tabs
  (Map, Ranks, Feed, Profile). There is no "Gets Near You" tab, screen, or deals
  list, and we do not re-add one. Gets surface on the map (venue detail) and in
  the feed as a reward layer, discovered vibe-first, never a list to shop by
  discount size. A deals catalog inverts monetization (it rewards the biggest
  discounter, usually a non-paying venue) and breaks the discovery DNA.
- **Wallet lives in Profile.** Earned-but-unredeemed codes (`useUnclaimedRewards`
  - `RedemptionCodeCard`) render in `ProfileScreen` (web) and the profile tab
    (mobile). It is utility, a code to show staff, not a discovery surface.
- **Only proximity-gated reads.** The single consumer discovery read is
  `GET /v1/rewards/near-me` (plus the user's own
  `GET /v1/users/me/unclaimed-rewards`). No global events/offers feed, list, or
  search. Enforced by
  `backend/src/features/rewards/__tests__/no-global-events-feed.test.ts`.
- **Ranking mirrors the carousel.** `rankGetsByVibe`
  (`backend/src/features/rewards/ranking.ts`) orders by taste, aliveness,
  business tier, has-live-gets, distance, id: the same signal order as
  `vibeRank`. Tier participates (founder-approved) but sits below taste and
  aliveness, so a paid get must still be on-taste and alive to lead. Reach is the
  paid product; feed position is earned, never bought outright.

## Receipt: what GlyphCity claims it did

The owner-facing proof of demand is one Receipt per window, never a causal
claim. Decisions and thresholds: `docs/decisions/proof-of-demand.md`.

- **Found_You vs Walk_In, server-derived.** A check-in is Found_You only when
  the consumer opened that venue in GlyphCity first: a sourced Venue_Open
  (`share`, `push`, `search`, `map`) inside the Attribution_Window (6h) that
  also clears the Away_Gate (at least 20 minutes before the check-in, or a
  known position outside `AWAY_DISTANCE_METRES`). Everything else is a Walk_In,
  including every pre-spec check-in. `foundVia` is resolved on the server
  (`backend/src/features/check-in/found-via.ts`); a client-supplied value is
  ignored.
- **One Receipt, one home.** `computeReceipt` and `buildReceiptCopy`
  (`backend/src/features/reports/`) produce every owner-facing split: live
  panel, check-in badge, weekly digest, trial and renewal emails, Plans panel,
  boost scoreboard. No surface counts or phrases the split itself.
- **Measurement verbs only.** Copy says what was recorded, never what we
  caused. `BANNED_CAUSAL_VERBS` (`brought`, `drove`, `generated`, `boosted`)
  plus revenue, ticket and spend language stay out of owner copy, enforced by
  the honest-copy property test. Values below the Suppression_Floor say less
  rather than rendering a number, and a zero Receipt offers exactly one next
  step.

## Tonight and Going

Tonight is what a venue says will happen. Going is consumer intent. Neither is
presence, and neither may be dressed as presence (`honest-presence.md`).

- **Tonight is a Dated_Slot on the existing Music_Schedule**, business-wide like
  the weekly grid, within 14 days, headline max 60 chars, at most one featured
  get. A dated slot shadows the weekly slot on its date. No second schedule
  store.
- **Tonight renders regardless of the live-vibe flags.** Headline, start time
  and featured get show on the venue card, the detail Tonight block and the
  share snapshot. The detail label is "Expected tonight", below the
  Presence_Floor, so it never reads as a crowd.
- **Going never touches the live signal.** Pulse, momentum, beam brightness and
  `vibeRank` order are invariant under any Going count (property test).
- **Going is public only at `GOING_PUBLIC_THRESHOLD` (3) and only with a
  Tonight.** Below that the card shows nothing and only the detail block offers
  "Be the first to mark going". The owner-facing live panel shows the true
  count, including zero. Wording is "marked going", never "coming" or "will
  arrive".
- **Going rows expire on their own**, Monday 12:00 SAST after the digest pass
  that covers the night, so the weekly pass can still read them and no sweeper
  exists. They carry `userId` and nothing else, and the erasure worker deletes
  both rows of a pair.

## Casual-customer First-Get flow

The token-based casual-customer "First-Get" flow
(`backend/src/features/rewards/guest-claim.ts`) replaced the original
phone-based guest-claim model. Tokens are 8-character Crockford base32 (no I, L,
O, U). Phone-number and SMS paths are permanently banned: see
`no-sms-no-phone-auth.md`.
