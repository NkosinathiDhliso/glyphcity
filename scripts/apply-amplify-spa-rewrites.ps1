.SYNOPSIS
    Apply the Amplify custom rules (rewrites) for all four Area Code apps.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the single source of truth for Amplify custom rules. It replaces the
    former pair of scripts (add-spa-rewrites.ps1 + apply-amplify-spa-rewrites.ps1)
    that both wrote the same `amplify update-app --custom-rules` field and
    disagreed about its contents (dry-reuse-no-duplication.md).

    Rules are ORDER SENSITIVE. Amplify evaluates them top to bottom and stops at
    the first match, so every specific rewrite must sit ahead of the SPA
    fallback, which matches nearly every extensionless path.

    Per app:
      web       /api/<*>   ->  API Gateway               (Spotify OAuth callback)
                /node/<*>  ->  GET /v1/share/node/<*>    (Share_Preview, OG tags)
                SPA fallback -> /index.html
      business  /api/<*>, SPA fallback
      staff     /api/<*>, SPA fallback
      admin     /api/<*>, SPA fallback

    The /node/<*> rewrite is consumer-only on purpose: the Share_Preview route
    renders venue OG tags for link unfurlers (WhatsApp) and then redirects the
    visitor to /map?venue={slug}&src=share, which only the consumer app serves
    (proof-of-demand R12.2).

    JSON is always passed to the AWS CLI through a file. PowerShell mangles
    inline JSON arguments (see rules/tech.md, "Common gotchas").

    Safe to re-run: update-app replaces the whole rule set, so the run is
    idempotent. No rebuild needed, rules take effect immediately.

    Requires: AWS CLI configured with credentials that can call amplify:UpdateApp.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Print the rule set each app would receive and exit without calling AWS.
