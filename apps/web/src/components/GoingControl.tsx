/**
 * The Going control on the consumer venue detail (proof-of-demand R9.2, R9.3).
 *
 * One tap records that the consumer means to be there tonight, and one more
 * withdraws it. That is all it is: INTENT, before doors. Nothing here reads as
 * presence and nothing here feeds one. The wording is always "marked going", so
 * neither the consumer nor the owner can mistake it for "who is here"
 * (`honest-presence.md`, R9.3).
 *
 * What it is allowed to say about other people comes from one shared rule,
 * `goingCountToShow`: a count only at or above the Going_Threshold and only when
 * the venue has a Tonight, so the card and this block can never disagree (R9.2).
 * Below that it offers the invitation and says nothing about numbers.
 *
 * The count on the city payload is a cached, shared number, so it seeds the
 * control but cannot carry the viewer's own mark. The viewer's mark is read once
 * from the venue detail, and only for a signed-in consumer: an anonymous reader
 * has no mark to show, and tapping takes them to sign-in instead.
