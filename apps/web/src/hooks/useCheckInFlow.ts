/**
 * Commit-mode check-in flow for the Map Discovery / Peek-Carousel experience.
 *
 * This hook is the single orchestrator behind the Commit_Mode check-in CTA. It
 * binds the pure CTA contract ({@link getCtaInfo}), the QR parser
 * ({@link parseVenueQr}), the shared {@link useCheckIn} request hook, the
 * geolocation state machine ({@link useGeolocation}), and the relevant stores
 * (consumer auth, connectivity, error, selection, map) into the handful of
 * handlers and flags that `MapScreen` (task 17.1) wires into the UI.
 *
 * What it drives:
 *   - the check-in CTA label/disabled state, derived from Geo_Status, the
 *     GPS-too-far QR fallback flag, and the in-flight pending flag (R14.1,
 *     R10.6, R10.7);
 *   - opening the consumer auth `SignInSheet` (email/password + Google OAuth)
 *     when the consumer is unauthenticated - there is NO phone-number or SMS
 *     surface anywhere in this flow (R14.3, R20.1, and the no-SMS steering rule);
 *   - offering the in-app `QrScannerSheet` when GPS places the consumer too far
 *     to check in (R14.4);
 *   - routing a scanned QR through {@link parseVenueQr}: a valid venue
 *     QR runs the check-in for the scanned venue (R14.5); anything else surfaces
 *     an invalid-QR message via the error store and performs no check-in
 *     (R14.6);
 *   - failing safe when offline - a check-in attempted with no connectivity
 *     surfaces a failure and never reports a false success (R19.3);
 *   - preventing duplicate submissions while a request is in flight (R14.8),
 *     claiming the guard before the awaited location request so a double tap
 *     cannot start two geolocation attempts (R15.23).
 *
 * This feature is strictly client-side UI: it adds no backend service and no
 * always-on resource (serverless-only rule), and the only auth entry it can
 * open is the `SignInSheet`.
 *
 * Feature: map-discovery-experience
 * Validates: Requirements 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.8, 19.3, 20.1, 15.23
