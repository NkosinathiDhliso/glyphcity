# Deployment Checklist

## Release Ritual

This is the single source of truth for a full prod release. It is the exact,
ordered sequence that takes a green working tree to a verified prod. Run the
steps in this order. Every other deploy doc links here rather than restating the
sequence. The supporting sections below cover script flags and one-off paths,
not ordering, so read this list first.

Order matters at each step: a frontend push auto-deploys via Amplify, but the
backend deploys only when `deploy-serverless.ps1` runs, so the backend must
follow the push, and the go-live check must follow the backend.

1. Pre-flight gates, all green before proceeding. For infra changes also run
   `terraform fmt -check -recursive infra/` and `terraform validate` in the
   changed environment.

   ```powershell
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   pnpm lint
   pnpm guard:serverless
   ```

2. Commit the working tree in reviewable commits. If any in-flight fix is
   incomplete at ship time, list it by name in the commit body as known-pending
   rather than leaving it silent.

   ```powershell
   git add -A
   git commit
   ```

3. Push `master`, then wait for all four Amplify apps (web, business, staff,
   admin) to report SUCCEED on the pushed sha before continuing. A partial set
   of green builds is not done.

   ```powershell
   git push origin master
   ```

4. Set or refresh Amplify env vars only if any `VITE_*` key changed. The script
   merges managed keys over the current app env, so it is safe to run when
   nothing changed. It now manages the Cognito Hosted UI domain and client-id
   keys, `VITE_CDN_URL`, and `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` in addition to the API,
   WebSocket, Mapbox, and RUM keys. Rebuild the apps that gained a key so the
   new value is baked into the bundle.

   ```powershell
   ./scripts/update-all-amplify-apps.ps1
   ```

5. Deploy the backend (build, terraform apply, Lambda code push). Review the
   `terraform plan` the script prints before you confirm the apply. Any
   unexpected destroy is a stop.

   ```powershell
   ./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -Environment prod
   ```

6. Run the go-live check with a fresh authenticated WebSocket token. All gates
   must pass, including Sha_Parity (the API `/health` `commit` matches the
   latest successful Amplify build sha on master), the authenticated WebSocket
   probe, and the table-closure and Amplify-env-closure checks. Without
   `-WsToken` the authenticated socket probe reports SKIPPED, never PASS.

   ```powershell
   ./scripts/go-live-check.ps1 -Environment prod -WsToken <fresh token>
   ```

## Pre-deploy build check (optional, reference)

The Release Ritual gates in step 1 are the required checks. As an extra local
guard before pushing, you can build every frontend the way Amplify will, so a
build break surfaces on your machine instead of in the Amplify job:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm --filter backend build:lambda  # must produce backend/dist/{lambda,websocket,workers}
pnpm --filter web build
pnpm --filter business build
pnpm --filter staff build
pnpm --filter admin build
```

If any frontend build fails, the Amplify build will also fail, so fix it before pushing.

## Deploy Backend (script flags, reference)

Step 5 of the Release Ritual runs the full deploy (build + terraform apply +
Lambda code push). These flags narrow what it does:

| Flag                | Effect                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `-SkipBuild`        | Reuse the existing `backend/dist/` bundle  |
| `-SkipTerraform`    | Deploy Lambda code only (no infra changes) |
| `-TerraformOnly`    | Apply infra only; do not touch Lambda code |
| `-Region us-east-1` | Override region (default `us-east-1`)      |

Quick path for an API-only change:

```powershell
./deploy-api.ps1 -Env prod
```

## Infrastructure Applies via GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/terraform.yml` runs whenever a push to `master` touches `infra/**`. It applies infrastructure in two legs:

- **Dev** applies automatically. The `apply-dev` job runs `terraform apply -auto-approve` with no gate.
- **Prod** waits for a human. The `apply-prod` job declares the `prod-infra` GitHub environment, which is configured with a required reviewer. It runs only after `apply-dev` succeeds.

### Prod approval flow

1. A push to `master` that changes `infra/**` triggers the workflow.
2. `apply-dev` applies dev automatically.
3. `apply-prod` runs `terraform init` and then `terraform plan`, so the plan is visible in the job output before anything is applied.
4. The job then pauses on the `prod-infra` environment and waits for a required reviewer.
5. A reviewer opens the run in the GitHub Actions UI, reads the surfaced plan, and approves or rejects.
6. On approval the `terraform apply` step runs against prod. On rejection nothing is applied.

Pull requests that touch `infra/**` still run `terraform plan` for both dev and prod and post the result as a PR comment. Only `master` pushes apply.

### Break-glass path

When the workflow is unavailable or an urgent change cannot wait for the approval queue, the canonical scripted path stays available:

```powershell
./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -Environment prod
```

This is the repo's standard prod deploy path (build + terraform apply + Lambda code push). Run `terraform plan` intent applies here too: the script wraps `terraform apply`, so review the plan output it prints before confirming. Use this path deliberately, not as the default, since it bypasses the required-reviewer gate.

## Consent Version Bump (founder-timed)

Bumping `AREA_CODE_CONSENT_VERSION` re-prompts every existing consumer to accept the current legal terms once on next open. It is a deliberate, founder-timed ops step. Run it in its own deploy window. Do not bundle it with unrelated infra or code changes.

### Prerequisites (verify before the prod bump)

1. The consumer re-consent gate (`ReconsentGate` in `apps/web/src/components/ReconsentGate.tsx`, wired in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`) is deployed to prod. Without it the env bump changes only what the backend records for new consents and what the admin re-consent list reports; it does not surface a prompt to existing users.
2. The dev rehearsal (task 7.1) is verified: dev runs `AREA_CODE_CONSENT_VERSION=v1.1`, one re-consent prompt fires in the dev consumer app, the new version is recorded, and the admin Consent Audit re-consent list behaves as expected.

### The change

One line in `infra/environments/prod/main.tf`, in the prod API Lambda environment block:

```hcl
AREA_CODE_CONSENT_VERSION = "v1.0"   # change to "v1.1"
```

Apply it as its own infra-only deploy, not bundled with other changes:

```powershell
./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -Environment prod -TerraformOnly
```

The gated `terraform.yml` workflow is the alternative when the change lands via a `master` push to `infra/**`. Either way the plan should show a single env var change on `area-code-prod-api`. Confirm the value after apply:

```powershell
aws lambda get-function-configuration `
  --function-name area-code-prod-api `
  --query 'Environment.Variables.AREA_CODE_CONSENT_VERSION' `
  --output text --region us-east-1 --no-cli-pager
```

### Release note

Post this in the deploy record for the window:

> Consent version bumped from v1.0 to v1.1 in prod. Every existing consumer sees a one-time re-consent prompt on next app open, asking them to accept the updated Terms (tier-permanence clause). Accepting records v1.1 and preserves the session; the prompt does not appear again. The admin Consent Audit re-consent list will populate with all pre-bump users (latest recorded consent still v1.0) until each re-consents. No other behaviour changes.

### Rollback

Revert `AREA_CODE_CONSENT_VERSION` from `v1.1` back to `v1.0` and re-apply infra only. This stops new re-consent prompts immediately. Consents already recorded at `v1.1` are harmless: they are simply a newer accepted version and require no cleanup.

## glyphcity.com cutover (one-time, glyphcity-rebrand 8.8)

A hard switch: no redirect and no dual-domain period (R7.5). Sign-in on
areacode.co.za stops the moment the Cognito redirect URLs change, so every
step below runs in one window, in this order.

### Before the window

1. Confirm the glyphcity.com nameservers at Namecheap match
   `terraform output glyphcity_name_servers`.
2. Google Cloud console and Spotify developer dashboard: apply every item in
   the [External console checklist](#external-console-checklist-google-oauth-spotify-yoco)
   below. Add the glyphcity.com values next to the areacode.co.za ones and
   keep the old ones until the window closes, so sign-in works on both sides
   of the switch.
3. Keep the switch on a branch. Amplify builds on every push to `master`, so
   the merge is the step that ships the frontends.

### In the window

1. From the branch, `terraform plan` in `infra/environments/prod`. Expect
   replacements for the API and CDN certificates and domain names, the four
   Amplify domain associations and the health check, plus the new SES identity
   and records. Stop if anything else is replaced.
2. From the branch, `./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -Environment prod`
   (Terraform and the Lambda code together).
3. Wait for the SES identity to show Verified and the ACM certificates to show
   Issued.
4. `./scripts/update-all-amplify-apps.ps1` (defaults to glyphcity.com), then
   `./scripts/apply-amplify-spa-rewrites.ps1`.
5. Merge to `master` and push; Amplify builds the four frontends.
6. Yoco dashboard: point the payment webhook at
   `https://api.glyphcity.com/v1/webhooks/yoco` (Yoco item in the checklist
   below). The old API host is gone after step 2, so webhooks fail until this
   is done.
7. `./scripts/go-live-check.ps1` must pass against the new domains.

### After the window

1. Remove the areacode.co.za values from the Google branding, authorised
   domains and JavaScript origins, and the old Spotify redirect URI.
2. Reprint venue QR posters: old posters encode areacode.co.za/qr/... and no
   longer reach the app.
3. areacode.co.za now carries only Area Code's own site and company mail
   (decision 4 in `docs/decisions/glyphcity-rebrand.md`).

## External console checklist (Google OAuth, Spotify, Yoco)

These settings live outside Terraform, so they are set by hand. Check them on
the cutover, whenever a Cognito Hosted UI domain or app host changes, and when
a sign-in or callback error points at a mismatch. Hostnames come from
`infra/environments/prod/main.tf` and
`backend/src/shared/security/origins.ts`; if those change, change this list in
the same commit. Consent-screen detail (logo, scopes, brand verification) is in
`docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_BRANDING.md`.

### Google Cloud console, the shared OAuth client

All four pools use the one Google client (`local.google_oauth` in prod
Terraform).

OAuth consent screen (Branding):

| Field                 | Value                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| App name              | `GlyphCity`                             |
| Application home page | `https://glyphcity.com`                 |
| Privacy policy link   | `https://glyphcity.com/legal/privacy`   |
| Terms of service link | `https://glyphcity.com/legal/terms`     |
| Authorised domains    | `glyphcity.com`                         |
| User support email    | `support@areacode.co.za` (company mail) |

Authorised JavaScript origins (the prod list in `origins.ts`, without the
Amplify default hosts):

- `https://glyphcity.com`
- `https://www.glyphcity.com`
- `https://business.glyphcity.com`
- `https://staff.glyphcity.com`
- `https://admin.glyphcity.com`

Authorised redirect URIs, one per wired pool's Cognito Hosted UI domain. These
do not change with the app domain:

| Pool     | Redirect URI                                                                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consumer | `https://area-code-prod-consumer.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/idpresponse`    |
| Business | `https://area-code-prod-business-v2.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/idpresponse` |
| Staff    | `https://area-code-prod-staff-v2.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/idpresponse`    |
| Admin    | `https://area-code-prod-admin.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/idpresponse`       |

The domains are `aws_cognito_user_pool_domain.consumer_v2`, `.business_v2`,
`.staff_v2` and the `cognito_admin` module default. Confirm with
`terraform output cognito_business_hosted_ui_domain` and
`cognito_staff_hosted_ui_domain`. The app-side callback and logout URLs
(`https://glyphcity.com/auth/callback` and the matching portal hosts) are set
on the Cognito app clients in Terraform, not in Google.

### Spotify developer dashboard

Redirect URI: `https://glyphcity.com/api/v1/streaming/spotify/callback`. It
must match `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` (the `spotify_redirect_uri` variable in prod
Terraform) exactly. The consumer app's `/api/<*>` Amplify rule forwards it to
the API.

### Yoco dashboard

Webhook URL: `https://api.glyphcity.com/v1/webhooks/yoco`. If Yoco issues a
new signing secret for the changed webhook, rotate `yoco_webhook_secret` as in
[Yoco payment secrets](#yoco-payment-secrets).

## Deploy Frontend (reference)

Amplify is wired to the `master` branch of each app. Pushing to `master` (step 3
of the Release Ritual) triggers a build. Env-var provisioning and rebuilds are
step 4 of the ritual, via `./scripts/update-all-amplify-apps.ps1`. This section
is background, not a separate sequence.

## Amplify Custom Rules (rewrites)

`scripts/apply-amplify-spa-rewrites.ps1` is the only place Amplify custom rules
are defined. It writes the complete rule set for all four apps in one call per
app, so a run replaces whatever is in the console. Re-running it is safe and
idempotent, and rules take effect immediately with no rebuild.

```powershell
./scripts/apply-amplify-spa-rewrites.ps1            # apply to all four apps
./scripts/apply-amplify-spa-rewrites.ps1 -DryRun    # print the rule set, no AWS calls
```

Run it when a rule changes, after an app is recreated, or if a deep link starts
404ing. It is not part of the Release Ritual because the rules do not change per
release.

Rules are order sensitive: Amplify stops at the first match, so every specific
rewrite sits ahead of the SPA fallback, which matches nearly every
extensionless path.

| App      | Rules, in order                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| web      | `/api/<*>` proxy, `/node/<*>` share preview, SPA fallback |
| business | `/api/<*>` proxy, SPA fallback                            |
| staff    | `/api/<*>` proxy, SPA fallback                            |
| admin    | `/api/<*>` proxy, SPA fallback                            |

- **SPA fallback** (all four): any path without a known static-asset extension
  serves `/index.html` with a 200, so deep links, QR codes and refreshes reach
  the client router instead of a 404.
- **`/api/<*>` proxy**: forwards to the HTTP API so the Spotify OAuth callback
  resolves on the app origin (`SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` is
  `https://glyphcity.com/api/v1/streaming/spotify/callback`).
- **`/node/<*>` share preview, consumer web only**: rewrites to
  `https://api.glyphcity.com/v1/share/node/<*>` with a 200 so a shared venue
  link unfurls with real OpenGraph tags (venue name, live snapshot, image).
  The route then redirects the visitor to `/map?venue={slug}&src=share`. It is
  consumer-only because only that app serves the map arrival. Without this rule
  the SPA fallback swallows `/node/{slug}` and every share unfurls as the
  generic app shell (proof-of-demand R12.2).

Verify the share rule after applying, on the consumer origin:

```powershell
curl -fsS https://glyphcity.com/node/<slug> | Select-String 'og:title'
```

Two notes on scope. The API proxy stays on all four apps, as it was before the
rule set was consolidated into one script; only the consumer origin is
referenced by `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`, so narrowing it is a separate change.
Each app's `amplify.yml` also carries a stale `customRules` block listing only
the SPA fallback; the app-level rules this script writes are what production
serves, so treat the script as the source of truth and the yml blocks as rot to
remove in their own change.

## Post-deploy Verification

The Release Ritual ends with the go-live check (step 6), which is the gate. These
manual spot checks are a quick supplement, not a replacement for it:

```bash
# 1. Health endpoint
curl -fsS https://api.glyphcity.com/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","env":"prod",...}

# 2. A read path that touches DynamoDB
curl -fsS https://api.glyphcity.com/v1/nodes/johannesburg | jq '.nodes | length'
# Expected: a non-zero number

# 3. Watch the Lambda for errors for 5 minutes
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/area-code-prod-api --since 5m --follow
```

Portal smoke checks:

- <https://glyphcity.com>: map renders with nodes
- <https://business.glyphcity.com>: login lands on the venue editor
- <https://staff.glyphcity.com>: scan/entry screen loads
- <https://admin.glyphcity.com>: dashboard loads

## Load Smoke (dev, manual only)

`scripts/load-smoke.js` is a k6 script that loads the dev API on the consumer hot path: the city nodes read and a check-in burst. It is manual only, never wired to push or PR, to respect the dev budget.

It runs two scenarios:

- `nodes_read`: `GET /v1/nodes/{city}` at 50 requests/sec for 2 minutes.
- `checkin_burst`: `POST /v1/check-in` at 10 requests/sec for 30 seconds with a dev consumer token.

Pass thresholds (the run fails if any is breached):

- `http_req_duration` p95 < 800ms on each scenario.
- `http_req_failed` rate < 1% on the public nodes read (it must return 200).
- `server_errors` rate < 1% overall, counting only 5xx and network/timeout errors. The check-in route is rate limited to 10 requests per 60s per user, so a single-token burst is mostly 429 by design. Rate limit 429s and auth 401s are the server responding correctly under load, not faults, so they are not counted as errors.

### Run locally

Install k6 (`https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/install-k6/`), then point it at the dev API. Never point it at prod: the check-in burst writes real check-ins and consumes the prod budget.

```bash
k6 run \
  -e BASE_URL=https://<dev-api-host> \
  -e K6_DEV_TOKEN=<consumer bearer JWT for the dev pool> \
  -e CHECKIN_NODE_ID=<a dev node id> \
  scripts/load-smoke.js
```

Environment variables:

| Var                | Required | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BASE_URL`         | yes      | Dev API base, no trailing slash. No default, so dev is never guessed |
| `K6_DEV_TOKEN`     | yes      | Consumer bearer token for the dev pool. Never hardcoded              |
| `CHECKIN_NODE_ID`  | yes      | Dev node id for the check-in burst                                   |
| `CHECKIN_CITY`     | no       | City slug for the nodes read (default `johannesburg`)                |
| `CHECKIN_QR_TOKEN` | no       | QR token for the node; not needed on dev (check-in short-circuits)   |

Without `K6_DEV_TOKEN` the check-in requests return 401 and the scenario honestly reports an unauthenticated result rather than faking success.

### Run via GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/load-smoke.yml` runs the same script on `workflow_dispatch` only. Trigger it from the Actions tab. It reads `BASE_URL` from the `base_url` input or the `LOAD_SMOKE_BASE_URL` repository variable, the node id from the `checkin_node_id` input or the `LOAD_SMOKE_NODE_ID` variable, and `K6_DEV_TOKEN` from the repository secret of the same name. It is not on any push or schedule trigger, so it never runs automatically.

Record the first run's results in `docs/GO_LIVE_CHECK_RESULT.md`.

## Rollback

See `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for the full rollback matrix. Summary:

- **Backend**: re-upload the previous Lambda zip or point the `live` alias at the prior version.
- **Frontend**: Amplify console → redeploy a prior build.
- **Infra**: `git revert` the offending Terraform commit, then `./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -TerraformOnly`.

## Secrets and Variables

Secrets live in AWS Secrets Manager (`area-code/<env>/*`) and in Amplify app environment variables. Never commit:

- `infra/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars`
- `.env`
- `push-env.ps1`

All three are in `.gitignore`. If you need to rotate a secret, use `scripts/deploy-secrets.sh --env prod`.

### Yoco payment secrets

The Yoco keys live in `infra/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars` and are read by `terraform apply` (via `deploy-serverless.ps1`), which sets them as Lambda environment variables. Never commit real values.

| tfvars variable       | Lambda env var         | Source                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yoco_secret_key`     | `YOCO_PROD_SECRET_KEY` | Yoco dashboard > Developers > API keys > Live secret key                                |
| `yoco_webhook_secret` | `YOCO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`  | Yoco dashboard > Developers > Webhooks > the api.glyphcity.com webhook > Signing secret |

`yoco_webhook_secret` verifies the HMAC signature on every incoming payment webhook. If it is unset or wrong, the API rejects every webhook (fail-closed) and no payment ever activates a tier, so it must be present and correct in prod.

To rotate the webhook secret:

1. In the Yoco dashboard, open the `https://api.glyphcity.com/v1/webhooks/yoco` webhook and regenerate the signing secret.
2. Copy the new value into `yoco_webhook_secret` in `infra/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars`.
3. Apply infra only: `./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -Environment prod -TerraformOnly`.
4. Send a test webhook from the Yoco dashboard and confirm it is accepted (no 401 in `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/area-code-prod-api`).

## First-time Setup

Before the first deploy in a fresh AWS account:

1. Provision GitHub OIDC for deploy role: `scripts/setup-github-oidc.ps1`.
2. Populate Secrets Manager: `scripts/deploy-secrets.sh --env prod`.
3. Exit SNS/SMS sandbox if OTP delivery is in scope (see Pinpoint console).
4. `terraform apply` once from `infra/environments/prod/` to create the stack.
5. Run `./scripts/deploy-serverless.ps1 -Environment prod` to push Lambda code.
