# Area Code — End-to-End Tests

Playwright suite that automates the browser-driven portions of [`docs/UAT_CHECKLIST.md`](../../docs/UAT_CHECKLIST.md).

## Environments and prod safety (current reality)

Read this before running anything that authenticates or seeds.

- **No staging frontend exists.** All four Amplify apps (web, business, staff,
  admin) point at the prod API. There is no separate staging environment to
  target, so the parts of this README that assume a dedicated staging env
  (`.env.staging`, seeded pool IDs, the nightly full-suite run) describe an
  intended setup that is not currently wired.
- **Cognito seeding must never target prod pools.** `support/global-setup.ts`
  creates email-username users. Pointing it at the prod Cognito pools would
  write test accounts into real pools. Never do this.
- **The Read_Only_Sweep is the sanctioned prod layer.** The only e2e run that is
  safe against prod is the read-only sweep, which authenticates nothing and
  seeds nothing:

  ```bash
  cd tests/e2e
  pnpm exec playwright test --project=smoke --project=cross-cutting --project=mobile-sweep
  ```

  This is layer 2 of the go-live coverage model in
  `docs/GO_LIVE_CHECK_RESULT.md`: structural UI checks across the four portals
  (no overlay leaks, primary CTA reachable, no horizontal scroll, axe
  criticals), not authenticated flows.

- **Enabling the authenticated suite is an open decision, not something that
  works today.** The seeded/authenticated projects have never been runnable in
  any environment: seeding needs email-username business and staff pools, and
  before the `cognito-email-pool-cutover` spec no environment offered them, and
  no staging frontend exists to run them against. Turning the authenticated
  suite on requires a deliberate choice: stand up a staging environment, or
  authorize an explicitly scoped seeded prod run. Until that decision is made
  and recorded, treat the authenticated projects as not runnable.

Legend: ✅ automated · 🟡 partially automated, see notes · ❌ stays manual

## What's still manual (and why)

These cannot be automated reliably and stay in `UAT_CHECKLIST.md`:

- **Real Google OAuth** — Google blocks headless browsers
- **Real Yoco checkout** — use Yoco test mode + webhook stubs in CI
- **Real SMS OTP delivery** — needs a real phone or sandbox SMS quota
- **Real device QR scanning** — fake-camera frames are black, not scannable
- **Browser permission UI** (push, camera denial fallback) — not exposed
- **Screen-reader accessibility validation** (NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver)
- **Long-running memory leak observation**
- **Account deletion** — destructive, kept manual until soft-delete dry-run exists

These are encoded as `test.fixme()` cases so they appear in the report as
"Known manual" rather than silently absent.

## First-time setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp tests/e2e/.env.example tests/e2e/.env
# Fill in the staging URLs, pool IDs, AWS creds, and a long random password.

pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e install:browsers
```

## Running

```bash
# Full run against the env in tests/e2e/.env
pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e test

# Smoke only (no auth, no AWS)
pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e test:smoke

# UI mode for debugging
pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e test:ui

# Just one project
pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e test --project=admin
pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e test --project=cross-portal
```

### GlyphCity rebrand, locally

The `glyphcity-rebrand` project runs against local dev-mock servers and has no
smoke dependency. Start the four apps with the dev mock, and the web app with
Point_Mode built in (the flag has no runtime override):

```powershell
# one terminal per app, from apps/<app>
$env:VITE_DEV_MOCK='true'; $env:VITE_FLAG_POINT_MODE='true'; pnpm exec vite --port 5180 --strictPort  # web
$env:VITE_DEV_MOCK='true'; pnpm exec vite --port 5181 --strictPort                                   # business
$env:VITE_DEV_MOCK='true'; pnpm exec vite --port 5182 --strictPort                                   # staff
$env:VITE_DEV_MOCK='true'; pnpm exec vite --port 5183 --strictPort                                   # admin

# then, from tests/e2e
$env:E2E_CONSUMER_URL='http://localhost:5180'; $env:E2E_BUSINESS_URL='http://localhost:5181'
$env:E2E_STAFF_URL='http://localhost:5182'; $env:E2E_ADMIN_URL='http://localhost:5183'
$env:E2E_DEV_MOCK='1'; $env:E2E_POINT_MODE='1'
pnpm exec playwright test --project=glyphcity-rebrand --workers=1
```

Use one worker: the map renders on software WebGL headless, and parallel
workers starve the main thread. The glyphcity.com sign-in tests skip until
`E2E_LIVE_DOMAINS=1` is set after the domain cutover.

After a run, open the HTML report:

```bash
pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e report
```

## Test accounts

`support/global-setup.ts` provisions five Cognito users (one per role)
and re-uses them across runs. Emails follow `e2e-<role>@areacode.test`.

To keep the seeded users between runs (faster local iteration):

```bash
E2E_KEEP_USERS=1 pnpm --filter @area-code/e2e test
```

## Targeting environments

The four portal URLs and the API URL are read from env vars. Switch
environments by maintaining separate `.env.staging` and `.env.local` files.

> ⚠️ Do not run this against production. The seeded users would land in
> your real Cognito pools. Always target a dedicated staging environment.

## CI

- `quality-gate.yml` runs `@smoke` on every PR — public URLs only, no AWS.
- `e2e.yml` runs the full suite nightly + on `workflow_dispatch` against
  staging. It needs Cognito pool IDs and AWS creds in repo secrets.

## Stability tips

- Selectors are layered: `data-testid` first, then role + accessible
  name, then text patterns. See [`TESTID_AUDIT.md`](./TESTID_AUDIT.md)
  for which testids the apps should expose for maximum stability.
- Tests skip with a clear reason rather than failing when fixture data
  isn't available (`No nodes seeded`, `No nearby rewards`, etc). To get
  full green, your staging environment needs:
  - At least one public node in Johannesburg (lat ≈ -26.2041, lng ≈ 28.0473)
  - A reward published on a venue the test consumer can claim
  - The seeded business owner owning at least one node
- API contracts evolve — if a spec sees a 404 it doesn't recognise, it
  skips with the status rather than failing. Update the path in the
  spec when the API moves.
